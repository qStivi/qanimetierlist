# AGENTS.md  checklist for coding agents in this repo

Short by design. A checklist, not documentation. Full context: the repo's own SPEC/docs, REVIEW.md, CRITICAL_PATHS.md.

## Before committing  AUTHOR THE FIRST ITEMS (repo-specific invariants)
- [ ] Build and tests pass: `npm run lint` and `npm run build`
- [ ] No secrets/DSNs/tokens in code, tests, or logs
- [ ] All TypeScript compiles without errors

## PRs
- Fill the change note template fully  including **undo-how**; "can't state it" = not ready
- Pick the risk tier honestly; when in doubt round up
- Review agent findings: fix, or reply with a clear written reason **backed by evidence** (primary source, live check)

## Round discipline
- Review capped at 3 rounds. Round 4 = stop, rethink the approach (Layer 0).
- Re-reviews: new commits only.
- Red review check = reviewer broken, not code broken  check for the pipeline-failure comment before treating it as a finding.
